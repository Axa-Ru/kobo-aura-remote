## Enable telnet/FTP/SSH in Kobo Aura ebook reader

This hack enables telnet/ftp/ssh on a new Kobo Aura reader. To install simply execute:

    ./package

And place the resulting KoboRoot.tgz file in the Kobo's partition that appears as you plug the reader to your computer. Place it in the directory named `.kobo`. Once there you can unplug the ereader's usb and restart the device.

Tested on firmware version 3.15.0 (April 2015)
